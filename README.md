[![](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_ae2-jei-integration_downloads.svg)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ae2-jei-integration) 

This mod reintroduces the Just Enough Items compatibility layer that Applied Energetics 2 has removed in Minecraft version 1.21.

This includes various features such as:

* Recipes for all machine blocks
* Ingredient autofill
* Click and drag Ghost Ingredients
* Settings to sync the Terminal and JEI search
